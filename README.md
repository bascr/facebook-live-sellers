## Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand

A dataset from Facebook was used to identify clusters through an unsupervised algorithm. A step-by-step methodology was followed by first preprocessing the data by cleaning the data, treating missing values, outlier detection, feature selection and scaling. After training a K-Means model with different numbers of clusters and according to Elbow Method and Silhouette score, the best number of clusters was four, which corresponds precisely to the number of categories the data has previously. These categories were removed before training the model and were used only for comparison reasons.
